### Introduction

The brief was to create a full-stack web app with a RESTful API. The API was to be made with a Flask app and a PostgreSQL database and it was to be consumed by a React front end.

I made Interstitial a site designed for the sharing of creative projects made with code.


## Process
_Describe the process of building the game. How did you get started? How did you manage your time? How would you do things next time?_




### Challenges and wins
_Describe the biggest challenges.
  How did you overcome them?
  Did you decide to pivot because of time constraints?
  What did you learn from these problems?_

  The biggest challenge was working with a SQL database and using Python on the backend for the first time. It proved quite a shift from using Node.js because of the need to consider entity relationships.





## Future features
I would like to add in interaction between users. To allow them to message each other and to save work that they liked.
